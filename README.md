# what is a star party?
A star party is an open-source celebration for nerds.

## brief description
In a star party, you and your open-source pals get together and star each others' GitHub repos to show your appreciation for each others' awesome work! Typically, a star party is thrown in the form of a shared webpage with a big & mysterious button in the center.

## what does the big button do?

When you click the big & mysterious button, it should open up a new tab for each of the GitHub repos that you are celebrating in your star party! You can now star each repo one at a time, closing each tab as you cha-cha along. **Make sure to be logged in first**, or else you'll have to refresh every new tab that opens to login after.

## how do I host my own star party?

1. Create a fork of this repo on GitHub.


2. Edit the `repos.js` file to include the repos that you're celebrating together!

3. Change around the hyperlink in the `index.html` that refers to your organization, community, group, or whatever it is you call yourselves. We ask that you leave in the **"What is a star party?"** link at the bottom so that newbies have a place to go if they don't understand what to do, and to spread the star party to others!

4. (Optional) Change around the look & feel of your star party to suite your needs.

5.  Set up your repo to publish to GitHub Pages. This is where you'll hold your star party!

5. Copy the GitHub Pages link for your repo to share your newly-created star party with the world :)
